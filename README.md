I created a simple checkout cart Application using variables and data types to store user information by using Control flow statements (if/else, loops) for interactivity.
I also created an array for multiple items (e.g., products) by Using objects to represent complex data.
Implemented Asynchronous Features by including at least one asynchronous element using callbacks, promises, or async/await.
This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
